   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **MCP Server Not Responding**
   - Use the HTTP server for testing: `uv run python bits_http.py`
   - Check if all dependencies are installed: `uv sync`

3. **Subject Not Found**
   - Use exact subject codes or partial names
   - Check available subjects: `curl http://localhost:8081/subjects`
